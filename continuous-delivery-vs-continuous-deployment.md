# Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

Deploying changes to production can be risky, though if you have a comprehensive suite of tests, the risk should be minimized. Development environments exist to mimic production to allow teams to test their changes.

Continuous deployment means you _continuously deploy_ changes to production.

Continuous delivery means you _can_ continuously deploy changes to production, but it's up to the business to decide whether or not they want to - maybe they want to release changes gradually, or whatever the reason may be.
